## Methods summary
  
*This is still under construction---it is currenlty simply a copy of the material in the .README*
  
### Data
  
The starting point for this analysis was 321 *Individual recode* files. The question comes from the individual questionnaires, and started being asked from phase IV onwards, although not always. Removing the files which did not have the question `v632`, or where all the answers were NA leaves us with 144 files. 

This is 144 surveys conducted in 67 countries over the period 1998-2016. 

For each of the surveys only six variables are extracted 
(see [recode questionnaires](https://dhsprogram.com/publications/publication-dhsg4-dhs-questionnaires-and-manuals.cfm) for details):
  
* `v000`-- the wave code (this turns out to be a bad idea, since waves don't correspond to phases, go figure)
* `v005`-- the sample weights for individuals
* `v102`-- de facto type of place of residence (rural/urban)
* `v312`-- current contraception use
* `v502`-- current marital status
* `v632`-- *the* question: who decides on contraception.
                            
 _**Denominator:**_ The question is only asked of women currently married or cohabiting, who are currently using contraception.  
                            
 While in some cases the v`v632` question did gave 9 coded for missing values, this was not the case most of the time. So the variables `v312` and `v502` are used to ensure the correct denominator and the number of missing answers, looking only at women: 
                            
* who are currently married/cohabiting `v502 == 1`, and
* who are currently using contraception `v312 > 0`
                            
 Out of each dataset the weighted counts are calculated for the crosstabulation of `v102` and `v632` for eligible women. The possible answers for `v632` are:
                            
* 1--wife
* 2--husband
* 3--both
* 6--other
* (9--missing)
                            
However the last two options are not present in all surveys, so the crosstabulations are sized 2x3, 2x4 or 2x5, depending on the possible answers. Because `9` missing are explicitly listed in a few surveys, but not in most of them, in the latter the  `NAs` are calculated by elimination. This is how Kenya and Turkey stand out so massively, these respondents were not coded as `9s`, but as `NAs`. But I have no way of knowing how to interpret these outliers, i.e. the accompanying documentation is not helpful to figure out what happened here. 
                            
These counts are weighted using the women's sample weights ([see here](https://dhsprogram.com/data/Using-DataSets-for-Analysis.cfm#CP_JUMP_14042)), then the column-wise percentages are calculated to get the distribution within each type of residence (urban and rural), with 100% being the number of valid answers. 
                                                                                                   
The questions in each individual phase can be found in the following four model questionnaires:

#### Reproducibility
                                    
The whole process from downloading the data, extracting the files, cleaning and processing the data, saving outputs, plotting the charts and laying out the final poster/factsheet is fully documented and automated, and made publicly available in this repository. 
                                    
The repository contains all the code and instructions to recreate the whole process, short of the actual data themselves, which are available through a free  (for non-commercial purposes) registration with DHS. Even so, the summary tables that are required to produce the charts are made available here as well: [final.data.csv](results/human-readable/final.data.csv).
