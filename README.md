### Prerequisites

DHS data requires free (for non-commnercial purposes) registration. With the help of the [`lodown `](https://github.com/ajdamico/lodown) package all the data download and extraction is automated.

R, Rstudio (pandoc, make), Python, some sort of unzipping utility... If it works, don't break it.
